## Night At the Museum Review Blog

# Reflection 
- Unfortunately my team was not able to qualify to go to Night at the Museum because of out lack of features on out cpt website. 
- Even though we did not qualify I still went to look at some of my peers' projects. 
- Overall Night at the Museum was a fun time to look over different projects
- I saw some of my friends and I also met some new people as well. 

# Glows/Grow

- Some things that I feel that my team and I could grow on is splitting up the work load. I feel I was assigned a much harder job than any of my team so it took me some time. And because of the other events I had during the week I was nat able to acheive my goal
- But I dont only want to blame my group. I feel I should have spent more time than I already did on this. I get home itself by 7:30 and worked on the CPT project for at least an hour and 15 mintues on an aveage basis. Apparently that wasn't enought and I should have realized that before it was too late. 
- Some glows that my group had was communication. We made a group chat on messages and whenever one of us had a problem everyone else tried to help out and fix the problem. 
- Another glow with out comminication was with merge conflicts. Everytime someone commited we made sure that everyone was not also commiting anything or else we will have merge conflits.
