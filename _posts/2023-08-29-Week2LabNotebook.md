# Week 2 Lab Notebook:

---

## Game of life description:
I added the code for the game from the source provided in Slack announcments and added some styles to make it look more visually appealing.

### Problems:
> • A bug line existed in the source code, but when it was added to the code to run on the website, it did not function. Additionally, pasting this line in would have caused the page to crash.
>
> • When scrolling, the text, `Remix of game of life` would stay constant on the screen and would overlap with all elements of the website

### Solutions:
> • Removing the line was able to fix the website and it would continue to run properly
>
> • I removed the text element in the `HTML` code that contained the buggy text and the overlapping stopped

### Skills used/learned:
> • Editing `HTML` code to fix overlapping text errors

## Snake game description:
Using the source code for the snake game, I was able to add a playable and fully functioning snake game into the website.

### Problems:
> • On both localhost and github pages, I was unable to load the game page for some reason and the tab would time out

### Solutions:
> • I switched browsers and the page started working. It was an issue that only occured on Chrome

### Skills used/learned:
> • Adding `HTML` code to put a functioning snake game into the website
